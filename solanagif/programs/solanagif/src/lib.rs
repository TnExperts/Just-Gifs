* * Solana programs are stateless by design. They don't hold data permanently like Ethereum smart contracts do.
* * Solana programs interact w/ accounts. They can read and write data to and from accounts.
* * Solana programs can also make an "account" that it can interact with.
* * In Solana, users need to pay "rent" to store data in an account, equivalent to storing it in a database. 
* * The SystemProgram is a program the creators of Solana deployed that other programs can talk to â€” it has an id of 11111111111111111111111111111111
